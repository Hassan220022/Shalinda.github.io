                    Tourism is a process of spending time away from daily routine or home to pursue recreation, relaxation, and pleasure while using the commercial provision of services.
                    Tourism in a country has many benefits: it creates employment, boosts revenue, develops infrastructure, helps in cultural exchange, etc. Travel duration under tourism must be less than 12 months (a consecutive year).
                    So, What’s come first to mind when we hear the word Tourism?
                    The most common thought is to pack the rucksack and travel away from day-to-day life. That means the movement of people from their usual residence to another place.
                    Suppose your friend’s aim for the tour might differ from yours. For example, you may travel for recreation, but he may go for business.

                    Cultural and archeological tourism are considered the traditional kind of tourism in Egypt. Egypt embraces several Pharanoic, Greek and Roman historic antiquities 
                    and museums. Cultural tourism has started since the discovery of ancient Egyptian antiquities and the decipher of the hieroglyphics

                <p>
                    Ancient tourism is a type of tourism that focuses on the exploration of ancient sites and monuments. It is a form of cultural tourism. 
                    Egypt is has one of the greatest ancient places in history. 
                    
                    The most famous ancient places are The Pyramids of Giza, The Valley of the Kings, The Temple of Karnak, The Temple of Luxor, The Temple of Abu Simbel, 
                    The Temple of Kom Ombo, The Temple of Edfu, The Temple of Philae, The Temple of Dendera, The Temple of Edfu, The Temple of Philae,

                <h5>Domestic tourism</h5>
                <p>
                    Domestic tourism can be described as tourism involving residents of one country traveling within their own country. It does not involve the crossing of 
                    international borders at entry points. As early recorded history provides a glimpse into ancient tourism activities, domestic tourism is in fact the 
                    first form of tourism practiced. It has been a well-established practice, happening in every country or region in the world. A strong relationship 
                    among tourism and visiting friends and relatives and religious pilgrimage has been found in countries with a long history of domestic tourism (Rogerson and Lisa 2005). 
                    On the contrary, mass domestic tourism has only recently emerged due to increased disposable income, introduction of labor rights associated with leisure and vacation, 
                    governmental policy about the deregulation of internal movement, and so on (Scheyvens 2007).

                <p>
                    When it comes to medical tourism, Egypt is one of the wealthiest countries in the world. Egypt is also a land known for natural healing that contributes significantly 
                    to the health tourism market. It provides natural remedies based on natural resources such as suitable climate, mineral water springs, sulfur water baths, mud, and hot sand. 
                    All these things make Egypt a favorable destination for medical tourism, and that's why it is also known for "Therapeutic Tourism" worldwide.

                <h5>Adventure Tourism</h5>
                <p>
                    Adventure tourism has been on the rise in Egypt for the past few years, as more and more people opt out of the traditional beachside resort-type of vacation. As an alternative, adventure travel can include everything from extreme sports to other, potentially risky activities such as cycling, mountain biking, kayaking, safaris, bungee jumping and rock climbing.
                    If you’ve seen the photos but don’t know where to start, here are four options for your first trip. As its popularity grows, the options for the adrenaline junkie increase. Each company has its own personality and offers a different thing, so the right fit for you is the one that fits your flow and makes you comfortable.
                    Each of the featured companies organizes trips in Egypt as well as abroad, which is a great option for those on a tight budget and not a lot of vacation days

                    And just like most things on earth, those gorgeous little waterfalls would be totally off limits if it weren't for all those animals. So who knows why? If you've ever taken an animal safari through Africa then your friend might have heard about them…. And here's a fun video of people filming wild dogs roaming their park near Dar es Salaam (where Makkah is located) :

                <h5>
                    Philae Temple
                </h5>
                <p>
                    The monuments of Philae include many structures dating predominantly to the Ptolemaic Period (332–30 BC). The most prominent of these is a temple begun by Ptolemy II Philadelphus (285–246 BC), which he dedicated to Isis, the mother of Horus, the god of kingship. A scene in the mammisi, or birth room, where the birth of Horus was celebrated, depicts Isis suckling her son Horus in the marshes.
                    The temple of Isis was one of the last ancient Egyptian temples to remain active, as it continued to function until the reign of the Byzantine Emperor Justinian I (527–565 AD), who ordered the foreclosure of all pagan temples. It is here that a priest of Isis named Esmet-Akhom carved the very last dated hieroglyphic inscription, which dates to the late 4th century AD (394 AD). The temple was converted into a Christian church and many inscriptions were deliberately destroyed.
                    Nearby, there also is a temple dedicated to Hathor built by Ptolemy VI Philometor (180–145 BC) and Augustus, the first emperor of Rome (30 BC–14 AD). The Kiosk of Trajan (98–117 AD), which used to front the temple complex of Philae, still stands strong, despite its roof having disappeared. Its regular arrangement of columns made it an aesthetic delight and was regularly described or depicted by travelers to the island. Isis is once again central to this cult, as the emperor is shown making offerings to her, her consort Osiris, and their son Horus.
                    All these monuments were relocated from the original Philae island to the nearby island of Agilkia during the UNESCO Nubia Campaign in the 1960’s to rescue sites flooded by the construction of the Aswan High Dam.</p>

                <h5>Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut</h5>
                <p>
                    Hatshepsut (c.1473–1458 BC), the queen who became pharaoh, built a magnificent temple at Deir al-Bahari, on the west back of Luxor. It lies directly across the Nile from Karnak Temple, the main sanctuary of the god Amun. Hatshepsut’s temple, Djeser-djeseru “the Holy of Holies” was designed by the chief steward of Amun, Senenmut.
                    The temple consists of three levels each of which has a colonnade at its far end. On the uppermost level, an open courtyard lies just beyond the portico. Mummiform statues of Hatshepsut as Osiris, the god of the dead, lean against its pillars.
                    This is because Djeser-djeseru is Hatshepsut’s mortuary temple, where her cult was practiced after her death, when she attained the blessed state of Osiris. Far from being devoted solely to her, the temple also includes sections for the cults of 
                    her revered father Thutmose I, the goddess Hathor, and the funerary god Anubis. An altar, open to the sky and the sun, was dedicated to the cult of the solar Ra-Horakhty. Pride of place was given to Amun. At the far end of the upper courtyard, on 
                    the temple’s central axis, a passage cut directly into the living rock culminates in his sanctuary.
                    The temple’s walls are covered with beautiful painted reliefs depicting temple rituals, religious festivals, and even the transportation of obelisks from the quarry to their destination in Karnak Temple. Perhaps most interesting are the reliefs in the portico on the so-called Middle Platform. The decorative programme on the left side depicts Hatshepsut’s expedition to Punt, believed to be located near modern Eritrea. The inhabitants of this land, their dwellings, and surrounding environment are vividly recorded, as are the riches and exotic animals that the Egyptians brought back with 
                    them. On the other side of the portico, Hatshepsut relates how she is the rightful king of Egypt. She does this not only by claiming that her father Thutmose I had designated her as his heir, but by stating that her true father was none other than the god Amun himself.</p>

                <h5>Abu Simbel Temples</h5>
                <p> The Great Temple of Abu Simbel, in Nubia near Egypt’s southern border, is among the most awe-inspiring monuments of Egypt. It was cut into the living rock by King Ramesses II (the Great) of the Nineteenth Dynasty, around 1264 BC. The temple is most well known for the four imposing seated colossal statues that dominate its façade. One of these collapsed because of an ancient earthquake, and its fragments can still be seen on the ground.
                    Colossal standing statues of the king line the main hall, leading to the sanctuary where four deities are sat: Amun Ra, Ra Horakhty, Ptah, and a deified version of Ramesses II. The temple was built with such precision that on two days a year, the 22nd of February and 22nd of October, the sun’s rays enter the temple, cross the main hall, and illuminate the innermost statues.  
                    Another rock-cut temple to the north, known as the Small Temple, is dedicated to the goddess Hathor and Ramesses II’s Great Royal Wife, Queen Nefertari. On the façade of the Small Temple, her colossi are the same size as those of her husband, a very rare example of such display.
                    The two temples were moved from their original location in 1968 after the Aswan High Dam was built, as it threatened to submerge them. The relocation was completed thanks to an international effort led by UNESCO, and the temple was admitted into its list of World Heritage Sites in 1979.

                    Sharm El-Sheikh is the popular Egyptian resort town, which is filled with some of the world’s wonders. 
                    Historically, it was included in Israeli territory which was later returned back to Egypt in 1979. 
                    Although being uninhabited through most of the time in history, Sharm El-Sheikh gained particular 
                    significance due to its strategic location, which provides control over the narrow entrance to the 
                    Gulf of Aqaba. The area began to develop as a famous touristic site under the Israeli administration, 
                    and the efforts are continued by the Egyptians. The city has recently been a preferred tourist destination 
                    with visitors coming from all over the world; as the unique biodiversity of the marine world increases the 
                    number of visitors to the region, turning it into a popular destination for snorkeling. Home to hidden gems 
                    with its popular beach resorts, rich underwater habitat, beautiful coral reefs and unique diving spots, Sharm 
                    El-Sheikh lays in between Egypt's Cairo and Jerusalem, Israel.

If there is a hotel near you, it's possible for your room to be close enough to Doha airport and check-in will usually happen on flight out of Dhaka or after 7pm when airfares tend lower than those in cities like New York and London. There are often other accommodations too far away such as hotels located almost 200km west, about 5 minutes drive south of town where most people try their luck at camel racing (as I'm told). As an alternative if no place nearby exists but can still help travellers avoid going through security checkpoints one may want simply use Facebook friend list

                            There are a few things going on here that should be made clear: First, it is totally reasonable to think Phila was destroyed because of an accident rather than its exploration being impacted by natural causes (unless you're one who thinks these events must have happened), but I am also fully convinced this will come down in the end to other reasons like water getting into orbit or something similar instead causing catastrophic damage then all those years later when we finally find out what caused them. Second at no point does anything seem remotely close enough for us scientists to call such catastrophes "crimes", so how do we know? They probably didn't happe
